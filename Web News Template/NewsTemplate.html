  <h1 class="articleTitle">Musk’s SpaceX Launches Second Batch of Starlink Satellites</h1>
  <div class="article">
    <p class="articleCont">
    SpaceX has been forced to scrub a potentially record-breaking launch of its latest batch of Starlink satellites.
    Sunday’s mission from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida would have been the seventh launch of the same Falcon 9 rocket  – a record for a reusable booster.
    SpaceX boss Elon Musk has previously said that the Falcon 9 rocket could be used up to 10 times before needing any significant refurbishment. Ultimately they could fly up to 100 times if given periodic overhauls.
    There may be another chance to attempt the record-breaking mission on Monday, though it will depend on favourable weather conditions at the launch site and across the Atlantic Ocean.
    <br>
    If successful on Monday, SpaceX’s Starlink launch will mark the 100th flight of a Falcon 9 rocket.
    The 16th Starlink mission is hoping to deliver a further 60 satellites into low-Earth orbit as part of SpaceX’s plan to build a massive constellation capable of beaming high-speed internet down to Earth.
    There are already more than 800 Starlink satellites in operation, which are currently being used on a limited scale in northerly parts of the US and Canada. <br>
    Musk said earlier this month that people in more southerly latitudes could expect to receive Starlink coverage in January, while those outside of North America will have to wait until SpaceX receives regulatory approval.
    <br>
    Starlink’s website states that it hopes to offer space-beamed broadband to 99 per cent of the inhabited world.
    “With performance that far surpasses that of traditional satellite internet, and a global network unbounded by ground infrastructure limitations, Starlink will deliver high speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable, expensive, or completely unavailable.”

      The goal of the Mars Exploration Program is to explore Mars and to provide a continuous flow of scientific information and discovery through a carefully selected series of robotic orbiters, landers and mobile laboratories interconnected by a high-bandwidth Mars/Earth communications network.
      We are not done studying Mars. NASA will be launching the Insight mission in 2018 to study the interior of Mars. For the first time, we'll get sophisticated geophysical measurements from the interior, including heat flow and measurement of seismic activity.
      <br>
      In 2020, NASA will also send the Mars 2020 rover to continue seeking the signs of life on Mars. Another aspect of the Mars 2020 rover mission will be to collect carefully documented rock and soil samples that we hope to return to Earth for study.
      <br>
      Other countries (and even some private companies) have also become very interested in Mars and will be sending spacecraft there.
      In 2020 alone, five other spacecraft are currently scheduled to launch: the ExoMars rover (European Space Agency), the United Arab Emirates Hope Orbiter, a Japanese orbiter, a Chinese rover and a SpaceX Dragon capsule.
      <br>
      NASA is also planning to send humans to Mars sometime in the future. Preparations are being made, primarily through our robotic exploration in collaboration with the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD) and the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD).
      The Mars 2020 rover will help us understand the current weather, winds, radiation, and dust environment, and will demonstrate technologies that will help humans once there.

      We will collaborate with our commercial and international partners and establish sustainable exploration by the end of the decade. Then, we will use what we learn on and around the Moon to take the next giant leap – sending astronauts to Mars.
      <br>
      Artemis is the first step in the next era of human exploration.
      Together with commercial and international partners, NASA will establish a sustainable presence on the Moon to prepare for missions to Mars.

  <div class="article">
    <p class="articleCont">
      Gene therapy may help astronauts going to Mars resist deadly radiation.
      Researchers say new discoveries and drug creation could be beneficial to future astronauts on deep space missions.
      <br>
      An international group of researchers has come up with a new plan to help astronauts survive high-level radiation in space – and even get them to Mars without the deadly exposure expected during three years of space travel.
      It is estimated that a return trip from Mars would expose astronauts to radiation doses of 600 mSv – a large proportion of the lifetime cap Nasa sets for space travellers of 800-1200 mSv.
      <br>
      Scientists in this field of study are proposing to build upon knowledge already gained in the study of human aging. Part of the plan is to make some human cells radioresistant.
      Scientists want astronauts to have personalized drugs tailor-made for their own bodies. To do this, they will have to use artificial intelligence to pinpoint which cells are more resistant than others, and fortify them using gene therapy.

      In a VASIMR® engine, gas such as argon, xenon, or hydrogen is injected into a tube surrounded by a magnet and a series of two radio wave (RF) couplers The couplers turn cold gas into superheated plasma and the rocket’s magnetic nozzle converts the plasma thermal motion into a directed jet.
      <br>
      Ad Astra successfully completed one of the three remaining major technology milestones in the NextSTEP Partnership Program contract with NASA for the maturation of the VASIMR engine.
      With these results, the VASIMR system is now fully positioned at technology readiness level (TRL) 5; that is, all critical engine components have now been operated at full power in a relevant environment under vacuum.

  <h1 class="articleTitle">The old suit gets an Upgrade</h1>
  <div class="article">
    <p class="articleCont">
      At first glance, NASA’s new spacesuit that will be worn on Artemis missions might look like the suits that astronauts use for spacewalks outside the International Space Station today.
      However, 21st century moonwalkers will be able to accomplish much more complex tasks than their predecessors, thanks to strides in technological advances that started even before the Apollo program.
      <br>
      Spacesuits are not only a classic icon of human space exploration, they are also a personalized spaceship that mimics all of the protections from the harsh environment of space and the basic resources that Earth and its atmosphere provide.
      <br>
      The new suit that will be worn on Artemis missions is called the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit, or xEMU for short.
      Its history is a tale of engineering evolution, traced all the way back to the Mercury space suits that were, themselves, upgraded Navy high-altitude flight suits.
      <br>
      The futuristic flight suits worn by Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken during Saturday's successful launch look a world away from the bulky orange shuttle flight suits worn when astronauts last launched from Florida's Kennedy Space Center.
      <br>
      The helmets are 3D-printed and the gloves are touchscreen-sensitive.
      <br>
      But their primary purpose remains the same - to protect crew members from depressurisation, where air is lost from the capsule. The suits also ensure astronauts have sufficient oxygen and regulate their temperature. A communications link and breathable air are provided via a single "umbilical" cable in the seat that plugs in to the suit.
      <br>
      Spacesuits have come a long way since the first spacewalk by the late cosmonaut Alexei Leonov in March 1965.
      br
Leonov's suit inflated after he stepped out into the vacuum, so that his hands came out of his gloves. Only by bleeding air out of the suit, which put the cosmonaut at risk of the bends, was he able to get back inside the spacecraft.

  <h1 class="articleTitle">The City of The Future</h1>
  <div class="article">
    <p class="articleCont">
      Peering into the future is a favorite exercise for planners and designers. From the Chicago 1893 Columbian Exhibition to New York City’s two Worlds Fairs (1939 and 1965) and beyond, the future was optimistic and filled with cool technology and architecture. But not all views of the future were so hopeful. George Orwell’s dystopian novel “Nineteen Eighty-Four” (published in 1949) looked 35 years forward and painted a not-so-rosy vision of the future.
      <br>
      In 2017, 1984 (the year) is a distant memory. But what do we think the future will look like 30 years or so from now? And what will City: 2050 be like?
      <br>
      By 2050 we’re likely to see public buildings begin to gather data from their occupants and visitors. They will use this data to constantly improve their performance, efficiency and of course the general maintaining of temperature and safety.
      <br>
      Buildings will utilise developments like solar windows to gather their own energy. They will become self-sufficient. Any surplus energy gathered will be offered to local vehicles and buildings that are running low.
      <br>
      Through advances in Low Power Wide Area Networks – a network technology that provides connectivity for a vast number of devices over long distances - we’re likely to see the potential of the Internet of Things sky-rocket. This is going to completely reshape our High Streets.
      <br>
      Imagine a world where clothes shopping is dominated by augmented reality and interactive dressing rooms. Your assigned interactive mirror will gather data like your dress size, fashion preferences and upcoming social calendar to make intelligent suggestions personalised to you.
      <br>
      Forget queuing for a cup of coffee. Order by the touch of a button and have your favourite option delivered on your commute – made just how you like it.

  <h1 class="articleTitle">Self Driving <br> The new norm </h1>
  <div class="article">
    <p class="articleCont">
      We will soon be entering a reality in which you will be able to get into your car and instead of fighting traffic and facing the irritation of your daily commute, you will be able to sit back and let your car do the driving for you. Up until just a few years ago, this scenario was reserved for sci-fi movies. However, in recent years, the concept of a self-driving vehicle has become a reality, with some of the world’s most well-known automotive and tech companies making great strides in the field – and sparking excitement among the investor community.
      <br>
      From the world’s leading car manufacturers to the tech companies that are shaping our daily lives – many entities are contributing to this field, making the autonomous vehicle industry a category of its own. As with all industry sectors, the self-driving car market is also scrutinised from a financial standpoint, and the potential is enormous: According to a study published by Intel1, the market could reach $7 trillion within the next 30 years.
      <br>
      A major component in driverless car technology is artificial intelligence led driving. Recent developments in machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT) and computer vision are making the dream of a car travelling from A to B on its own a reality.
      <br>
      Some of the companies developing such technology include Waymo (a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet), which has not been secretive about its project, with its test cars autonomously roaming the streets of Silicon Valley. Other companies focus on the hardware aspect, including chip manufacturing giant Intel, which claims to have technology in almost every self-driving test vehicle out there and has acquired Mobileye, a computer driver assistance technology company, for $15 billion.
      <br>
      Of course, there are numerous other forms of technology that are required for self-driving vehicles, including computer vision, GPS software and more – all of which are being tested and developed in various tech companies around the globe.

  <h1 class="articleTitle"> Beyond Reality </h1>
  <div class="article">
    <p class="articleCont">
      When we talk about Virtual Reality (VR), many of us think of science fiction films like 'Minority Report'. However, the truth is that nowadays, this technology completely blends in with our daily lives. Video games, medicine, education... Virtual Reality is here to stay. But what is it exactly?
      <br>
      Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated environment with scenes and objects that appear to be real, making the user feel they are immersed in their surroundings. This environment is perceived through a device known as a Virtual Reality headset or helmet. VR allows us to immerse ourselves in video games as if we were one of the characters, learn how to perform heart surgery or improve the quality of sports training to maximise performance.
      <br>
      Although this may seem extremely futuristic, its origins are not as recent as we might think. In fact, many people consider that one of the first Virtual Reality devices was called Sensorama, a machine with a built-in seat that played 3D movies, gave off odours and generated vibrations to make the experience as vivid as possible. The invention dates back as far as the mid-1950s. Subsequent technological and software developments over the following years brought with them a progressive evolution both in devices and in interface design.
      <br>
      That's enough about the theory that is projecting us into the future. Which sectors is Virtual Reality actually being used in today? Medicine, culture, education and architecture are some of the areas that have already taken advantage of this technology. From guided museum visits to the dissection of a muscle, VR allows us to cross boundaries that would otherwise be unimaginable.
      <br>
      Virtual Reality is one of the technologies with the highest projected potential for growth. According to the latest forecasts from IDC Research (2018), investment in VR and AR will multiply 21-fold over the next four years, reaching 15.5 billion euros by 2022. In addition, both technologies will be key to companies' digital transformation plans and their spending in this area will exceed that of the consumer sector by 2019. It is, therefore expected that by 2020 over half of the larger European companies will have a VR and RA strategy.
      <br>
      Nowadays, the market is demanding applications that go beyond leisure, tourism or marketing and are more affordable for users. Virtual interfaces also need to be improved to avoid defects such as clipping, which makes certain solid objects appear as though they can be passed through. Or to minimise the effects that VR produces in people, among them motion sickness, which consists of a dizziness induced by the mismatch between the movement of our body and what is being seen in the virtual world.
      <br>
      The big technology companies are already working to develop headsets that do not need cables and that allow images to be seen in HD. They are developing Virtual Reality headsets in 8K and with much more powerful processors. There is even talk that in the next few years they could integrate Artificial Intelligence. The latest 5G standard can also provide very interesting scenarios for the evolution of VR. This standard will allow more devices and large user communities to be connected. In addition, its almost imperceptible latency will make it possible for consumers to receive images in real time, almost as if they were seeing them with their own eyes.
      <br>
      All this means that Virtual Reality is no longer science fiction. It is integrated into our present and, in the coming years, it will lead to advances that will shape the future.

  <h1 class="articleTitle">Quantum Supremacy <br> A new medium of computation</h1>
  <div class="article">
    <p class="articleCont">
      Quantum physics has already changed our lives. Thanks to the invention of the laser and the transistor — both products of quantum theory — almost every electronic device we use today is an example of quantum physics in action. We may now be on the brink of a second quantum revolution as we attempt to harness even more of the power of the quantum world. Quantum computing and quantum communication could impact many sectors, including healthcare, energy, finance, security, and entertainment. Recent studies predict a multibillion-dollar quantum industry by 2030. However, significant practical challenges need to be overcome before this level of large-scale impact is achievable.
      <br>
      Although quantum theory is over a century old, the current quantum revolution is based on the more recent realization that uncertainty — a fundamental property of quantum particles — can be a powerful resource. At the level of individual quantum particles, such as electrons or photons (particles of light), it’s impossible to precisely know every property of the particle at any given moment in time. For example, the GPS in your car can tell you your location and your speed and direction all at once, and precisely enough to get you to your destination. But a quantum GPS could not simultaneously and precisely display all those properties of an electron, not because of faulty design, but because the laws of quantum physics forbid it. In the quantum world, we must use the language of probability, rather than certainty. And in the context of computing based on binary digits (bits) of 0s and 1s, this means that quantum bits (qubits) have some likelihood of being a 1 and some likelihood of being 0 at the same time.
      <br>
      Such imprecision is at first disconcerting. In our everyday classical computers, 0’s and 1’s are associated with switches and electronic circuits turning on and off. Not knowing if they are exactly on or off wouldn’t make much sense from a computing point of view. In fact, that would lead to errors in calculations. But the revolutionary idea behind quantum information processing is that quantum uncertainty — a fuzzy in-between “superposition” of 0 and 1 — is actually not a bug, but a feature. It provides new levers for more powerful ways to communicate and process data.
      <br>
      The quantum race is already underway. Governments and private investors all around the world are pouring billions of dollars into quantum research and development. Satellite-based quantum key distribution for encryption has been demonstrated, laying the groundwork for a potential quantum security-based global communication network. IBM, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and other companies are investing heavily in developing large-scale quantum computing hardware and software. Nobody is quite there yet. While small-scale quantum computers are operational today, a major hurdle to scaling up the technology is the issue of dealing with errors. Compared to bits, qubits are incredibly fragile. Even the slightest disturbance from the outside world is enough to destroy quantum information. That’s why most current machines need to be carefully shielded in isolated environments operating at temperatures far colder than outer space. While a theoretical framework for quantum error correction has been developed, implementing it in an energy- and resource-efficient manner poses significant engineering challenges.

  <h1 class="articleTitle">Homo Deus <br> The machine god </h1>
  <div class="article">
    <p class="articleCont">
      The aims of the transhumanist movement are summed up by Mark O’Connell in his book To Be a Machine, which last week won the Wellcome Book prize. “It is their belief that we can and should eradicate ageing as a cause of death; that we can and should use technology to augment our bodies and our minds; that we can and should merge with machines, remaking ourselves, finally, in the image of our own higher ideals.”
      <br>
      The idea of technologically enhancing our bodies is not new. But the extent to which transhumanists take the concept is. In the past, we made devices such as wooden legs, hearing aids, spectacles and false teeth. In future, we might use implants to augment our senses so we can detect infrared or ultraviolet radiation directly or boost our cognitive processes by connecting ourselves to memory chips. Ultimately, by merging man and machine, science will produce humans who have vastly increased intelligence, strength, and lifespans; a near embodiment of gods.
      <br>
      There is no doubt that human enhancement is becoming more and more sophisticated – as will be demonstrated at the exhibition The Future Starts Here which opens at the V&A museum in London this week. Items on display will include “powered clothing” made by the US company Seismic. Worn under regular clothes, these suits mimic the biomechanics of the human body and give users – typically older people – discrete strength when getting out of a chair or climbing stairs, or standing for long periods.
      <br>
      In many cases these technological or medical advances are made to help the injured, sick or elderly but are then adopted by the healthy or young to boost their lifestyle or performance. The drug erythropoietin (EPO) increases red blood cell production in patients with severe anaemia but has also been taken up as an illicit performance booster by some athletes to improve their bloodstream’s ability to carry oxygen to their muscles.
      <br>
      And that is just the start, say experts. “We are now approaching the time when, for some kinds of track sports such as the 100-metre sprint, athletes who run on carbon-fibre blades will be able outperform those who run on natural legs,” says Blay Whitby, an artificial intelligence expert at Sussex University.

  <h1 class="articleTitle"> Brain Implants <br> Cyborgs and AI </h1>
  <div class="article">
    <p class="articleCont">
      Elon Musk struck again!
      <br>
      Remember in 1996, Dolly the sheep became the first cloned mammal in the world. Some twenty years later, Gertrude the pig becomes the first animal who got a neural implant in her skull, which could potentially revolutionize how we communicate with computers and machines. “That’s one small step for piglet, one giant leap for mankind.”
      <br>
      In this article, we will explore the neurotechnology behind Neuralink, how Musk can potentially unveil a new world of bionic brains, what it means for us in the future, and of course not forgetting the possible ethical ramifications.
      <br>
      While Musk’s high profile entry into neurotech certainly drew a lot of frenzy around the development of a possible human symbiosis with machines, he is not alone in Silicon Valley. In the same year as Neuralink was announced, Bryan Johnson threw $100 million behind Kernel, a startup he founded to enhance human intelligence by developing brain implants capable of linking people’s thoughts to computers. Even Mark Zuckerberg has officially hinted Facebook’s interest in pursuing neurotech in a 2015 Q&A session by saying that one day “people will be able to share full sensory and emotional experiences, not just photos”. Facebook has since been hiring neuroscientists for an undisclosed project at Building 8, its secretive hardware division.
      <br>
      Elon Musk’s grand mission is, of course, to make science fiction a reality. Neuralink wants to be more than just a medical device to help paraplegics or patients suffered from brain injuries, by offering a shot at cognitive augmentation for healthy individuals (if they want) with a tiny brain implant. Musk’s motivation is that people would need to become cyborgs to be relevant in an artificial intelligence age. Neuralink tries to tickle the novelties of cognitive augmentation in a bi-directional capacity, i.e. to supplement the brain with computing power as well as the ability to communicate telepathically. Imagine that you can now simplify a complex mathematical equation without having to use a sophisticated scientific calculator or play a game without needing a sluggish middleman like a gaming console anymore.
